Definitly a real name for the next Monster Hunter game and not something I heard from a random post on reddit. At Capcom, we believe in sustainability and saving the enviroment. Which is why we release Monster Hunter in the most bare-bone state possible and make tiny updates to the game every few months eventhough we already finished everything at the time of release...

We will update the rest of this game description in April in the form of a paid DLC.
