Our CEO wants to make a few extra bucks before he gets fired by Microsoft, so here we are with a brand new sequel to the sequel of the world's most popular shooter, featuring 4 vs 4 gameplay and micro-transactions so expensive that even a CS:GO player would hesitate before making a purchase. Just buy it. BUY IT, IT'S FUN! No just kidding it's not. And you don't have to buy it because we work for Microsoft now and money is the last thing we care about.
